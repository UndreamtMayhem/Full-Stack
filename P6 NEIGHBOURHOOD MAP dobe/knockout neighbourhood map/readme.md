# Udacity Full Stack Project
##Project: Neighborhood Map
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a 
neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to 
this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d 
like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to 
support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement 
third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these 
locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
